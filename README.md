# A location for documentation, issues, and files associated with the DC 580 dc-dc buck-boost psu.

### `dc580 - 1.mov` is a clip illustrating an over voltage issue with initial 'on'.

### `From Retailer` is a directory with the files provided by the retailer for my unit.
 - I have not tried this software and do not plan to. Since there is a driver for the ch341 in the .zip I would guess it would be very easy to interface with the unit directly.

### Update about my unit:
I noticed several issues in opperaton and after some back and forth with the seller there appears to be a "software issue" with my unit. It looks like you could probabley update the software but they were unable to provide any updates. I really like the concept of this unit and I plan on buying another to test out but, buyer beware.
