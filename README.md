# A location for documentation, issues, and files associated with the DC 580 dc-dc buck-boost psu.

### `dc580 - 1.mov` is a clip illustrating an over voltage issue with initial 'on'.

### `From Retailer` is a directory with the files provided by the retailer for my unit.
 - I have not tried this software and do not plan to. Since there is a driver for the ch341 in the .zip I would guess it would be very easy to interface with the unit directly.
